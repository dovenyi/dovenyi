- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dovenyi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in keyboards, programming, giant trees, gardening, DIY stuff, guitars, speedcubing, logical layout design, evolutionary algorithms, etc.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PCB design, writing guides and curating the Keyboard Builders' Digest (https://kbd.news).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I'm u/dovenyi on Reddit where I'm mostly lurking on the r/MechanicalKeyboards sub.
